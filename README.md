    * Troubleshoot cluster component failure
    * Troubleshoot networking
3. Workloads & Scheduling | 15%
    * Understand deployments and how to perform rolling update and rollbacks
    * Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to configure applications
    * Know how to scale applications
    * Understand the primitives used to create robust, self-healing, application deployments
